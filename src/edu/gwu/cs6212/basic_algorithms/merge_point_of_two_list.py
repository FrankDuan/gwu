'''
Write a function to get the intersection point of two Linked Lists.
There are two singly linked lists in a system. By some programming error the
end node of one of the linked list got linked into the second list, forming
a inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked
list merge.

find the length of the two lists: m and n;
if m > n:
    move list1 to the (m-n)'th node
else:
    move list2 to the (n-m)'th node

compare the node of list1 and list 2 one by one
